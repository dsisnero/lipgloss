# Agent Instructions

This is a port of golang lipgloss. The golang code is the source of truth. Any
tests output must match the golang test output. Any logic must match the golang
src logic.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get
started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

**DO NOT use internal todo list or task list tools** - Use beads for all issue
tracking and work management:

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT
complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs
   follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
   * **Crystal-specific quality gates**:

      ```bash
      crystal tool format
      ameba --fix
      ameba
      crystal spec

```text

```

     ```text

     * **other gates**
       * rumdl format

      Ensure no formatting issues remain, all ameba errors are fixed, and all tests pass before committing.
3. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
4. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
5. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:

    ```bash
    git pull --rebase
    bd sync
    git push
    git status # MUST show "up to date with origin"
    ```

6. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
7. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
8. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

* Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
* NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
* NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
* If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
